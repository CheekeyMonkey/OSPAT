# OSPAT
Open Source Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Curriculum

## * _Work-in-progress_ *

## Introduction
This repository consists of a series of recommended book, articles, interviews, and videos that together cover most of the Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy knowledge, similar to a certification course.

While this curriculum cannot currently replace certifications that may be needed now or in the future to legally provide psychedelic-assisted therapy, it can largely supplement your learning and provide you with the foundational knowledge to succeed in the field.

For those of you interested in pursuing the path of providing pyschedelic-assisted therapy, this may still be useful to help complement your education and enable you to start learning now. This may be especially useful if you are on a waiting list for an industry certification training course but dont want to wait to start your education.

The curriculum includes all of the required and recommended reading material for the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies and Research Certificate program, as well as many other videos, articles, and recommended literature sources that can be found in the public domain. We lean heavily on the suggestions from leaders in the field, including but not limited to the [Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedlic Studies (MAPS)](https://maps.org/), [CIIS](https://www.ciis.edu/research-centers/center-for-psychedelic-therapies-and-research), [Integrative Psychiatry Institute (IPI)](https://psychiatryinstitute.com/ipi-year-long-psychedelic-assisted-therapy-training/), and others.

## Recommended Prerequisite Skills and Experience
If you are interested in the psychedelic-assisted therapy space or seeking training, be sure to read the MAPS article, [Information for People Seeking Training in Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy](https://maps.org/2021/10/29/information-for-people-seeking-training-in-psychedelic-assisted-therapy/)

Below are the minimum prerequisites that will give you a solid foundation before pursuing psychedlic-assisted psychotherapy training or the OSPAT curriculum:
1. Licensed professional with demonstrated competency in clinical psychotherapy (LPC, LMFT, LCSW, Clinical Psychologists, Counseling PhD and PsyD, Psychiatrists, Psychiatric Nurses, MDiv., MD, and BCC-Board Certified Chaplains, etc.)
2. Training in IFS, EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, MBSR/MBCT, Yoga Nidra, or other specialized therapies. 
3. Personal experience with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

## Structure
The curriculum is split into 2 parts, the core requirements and several elective options. The core requirements aim to cover the basic knowledge every provider of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy should be familiar with. This foundation will allow students to more easily absorb the information contained in the elective options.

Each section of the elective options has a minimum completion requirement.

For each textbook or video, a link is provided if the content is available on the open domain. The only content we will include that must be purchased will be books, and we will aim to include multiple sourcing links when available.

We will also include ISBN and PubMedID when available.
